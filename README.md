The purpose of this project was to develop a credit risk model to predict the likelihood of loan default using LendingClubâ€™s publicly available loan data. By accurately predicting the probability of default, this model aims to support financial institutions in making more informed lending decisions, thus minimizing potential losses while offering competitive loan options to borrowers.
